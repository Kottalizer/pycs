## Ignored nicks:
##  Add every nickname you want to ignore in stats after the '[l]' separated by commas.

## Ignored words:
##  Add every word you don't want to count after the '[l]' separated by commas.

## Minimum word length:
##  The minimum number of letters in a word to be counted for stats.

## Log format:
##  The name of the program you're using for IRC in lowercase letters.
##  Valid formats can be found in [your PYCS directory]/resources/formats.

## Path override:
##  If you fill this in after the '[l]', PYCS will ignore any path conventions it
##  has and use the comma-separated list of directories you supplied as the
##  directory to look for logs. It is not uncommon to use this option.

## Logs parent directories:
##  The name of the directories with your logs directory in it (eg. HexChat, mIRC).
##  Enter as comma-separated list after '[l]'. Will be overridden by Path override.

## Logs:
##  Enter the file names of the logs you want to analyze after the '[l]'.
##  PYCS will look for these in either the "Path override" directory or the directory it thinks your logs are in.

## Print progress:
##  Set it to True or False. If it's False, PYCS won't print its progress to
##  the console. This can be useful if you're scheduling PYCS.

## Swears:
##  Enter a comma-separated list of swears after the '[l]' - PYCS will count
##  those words as swears. Use '*' as joker character.
