## How to make PYCS compatible with your log format ##
 ####################################################


It is quite easy to create a new log format for PYCS - it does require some knowledge, though.

Create a file named "[your IRC program name].cfg" (eg. "xchat.cfg", "mirc.cfg"), all lowercase and without brackets or quotes. In this file, each line should contain the name of the pattern, an equals sign and the Python compliant regex pattern with a named group around the particular parts to match - nothing else.

A named group is formatted as parentheses around the paricular part to match, with the first characters inside the parentheses being a '?', a 'P' and the name of the group in <>s.

For example:

(?P<name>content)

Example of a line:

said line	=	^[a-zA-Z]+\s[0-9]+\s[0-9:]{8}\s<(?P<username>[A-Za-z_-\|]+)>\s(?P<username>.+)

(The tabs are there for readability, whitespace is irrelevant)

IMPORTANT:

If you do make your own format file and you're interested in making it a part of the default PYCS format collection, please contact me either at powpowd@gmail.com or @LpSamuelm on Twitter. I'll be happy to include it!

 #########################################
## The patterns you need to fill in are: ##
 #########################################

-- said line --
This regex should match all lines that people have said, using /say or simply typing a line to say. The named groups you will have to use are 'nickname' (which should match the nick that posted the line) and 'words' (which should match the actual line).

-- action line --
This regex should match all lines that people have spoken with a /me command or otherwise invoked an action. The named groups you will have to use are 'nickname' (which should match the nick that posted the line) and 'words' (which should match the actual line).

-- time --
This regex should match the time a line was posted. The named groups needed are 'hour' and 'minute', and each of them should match a two-digit representation of the hour or minute the line was posted.

####

After filling in these and putting this file in /resources/formats, it will be possible to change the "log format" value in settings.cfg to the name of your format in order to use it.
